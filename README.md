# Todo Apps

This project is a modern web application built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Bun.js. It provides a robust setup for developing and deploying React applications with efficient build processes and styling.

## Project Overview

The Todo Apps project is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It leverages the latest technologies to ensure a smooth user experience and fast performance. This project demonstrates my skills in integrating cutting-edge tools and frameworks to deliver a seamless application.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a fast development environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Bun.js**: A modern JavaScript runtime that replaces Node.js.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todo-apps
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**:

   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

5. **Preview the production build**:
   ```bash
   bun run preview
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Ensure Bun.js is installed on your system.
- Use the provided scripts for development and production tasks.
- Customize the application by modifying the React components and Tailwind CSS styles.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code of the application.
- **public/**: Contains static assets.
- **vite.config.js**: Configuration file for Vite.
- **tailwind.config.js**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.

## My Role

In this project, I was responsible for the entire development process, from setting up the project architecture to implementing the user interface and ensuring optimal performance. I tackled challenges such as integrating Bun.js with Vite and optimizing the build process for faster load times.
